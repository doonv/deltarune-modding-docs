Under construction documentation for DELTARUNE modding.

## Contributing

As of right now, I'm not sure how to structure everything, so make up shit as you go. Do what you think works the best.

Though if you plan to do some kind of big restructuring, please discuss it with me first on the [DELTAModders discord server](https://discord.gg/uKqHUrekvK).

## Build Instructions
